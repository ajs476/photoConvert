##### CS 430: Project 1, photoConvert
##### Created By: Alexander Sears, 2016

##### Purpose: 
# The purpose of this project/application is to read and write images in PPM format in C.  This application specifically is able to read # and write PPM files in P3 and P6 format.

##### Usage:
# 1.) Run included Makefile (make) - this should compile ppmrw.c
# 2.) input the following into terminal: ./ppmrw 3/6 "input.ppm" "output.ppm"
#USAGE NOTE: for 2.) using 3 as arg1 will convert input to P3, using a 6 will convert to P6


##### Special Notes:
# I was not sure if we had to name our project ppmrw or not, so I copied my existing c code into a file named ppmrw, you can see my original C code in the file "project1.c"

# The images that I created and tested are included in the repository as "tesImageAscii" and "testimageRaw", these files were created using GIMP
